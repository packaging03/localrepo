Obviously i am new to Civicrm hence that is why i have written the comment below and if i am wrong eventually, i would appreciate
a correction from you or the technical team

1. I discover that the two Civicrm Entities in question(Contribution and Contribution Page) which comprises almost all the data 
needed to populate on the table does not have a tight connection
2. Hence to really undergo the task, you have to create your own new Entity which will comprises all the data you needed.

Once the Entity is created, you just need to fetch from it and display it wherever you want which solve the task.

Please i would appreciate if there is another way to do this as i have said before.


I tried to do this but i encountered a challenge just because of civix not connecting with the database to create the new Entity 
and the Api for it.


This is the details of the error i am getting
